        1) Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but they have different scopes and behaviors.
        <br> <br><br>

    <h2> <b>Var Scope:</b></h2>

    Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means that they are only accessible within the function in
    which they are declared.
    If a variable is declared with var outside of any function, it becomes a global variable, accessible throughout
    the entire program.
    var does not have block-level scope. If it is declared within a block (like an if statement or loop), it is
    still accessible outside of that block. <br> <br><br>
    <h2><b>
            Let Scope:</b></h2>

    Variables declared with let are block-scoped. They are only accessible within the block (or statement) in which
    they are defined.
    let variables are not hoisted to the top of their scope, unlike var. This means that you cannot use them before
    they are declared. <br> <br><br>
    <h2><b>Const Scope:</b></h2>

    const also has block-level scope, similar to let.
    The key difference is that once a variable is declared with const, its value cannot be reassigned. However, this
    does not mean that the variable is immutable; it means the variable reference cannot change.

        2) Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
    </h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, null and undefined are both special values that represent the absence of a meaningful value. While
        they are similar in some ways, they are used in slightly different contexts.

    <h2> Null:</h2>

    Explicitly indicating the intentional absence of an object value.
    Clearing object references to free up memory.
    As a placeholder for an expected object value that will be assigned later.
    <h2> Undefined:</h2>

    Default value for uninitialized variables.
    When a function is called with fewer arguments than declared parameters.
    Accessing a property that doesn't exist in an object.
    Implicit return value for functions without a return statement.

    <h1>3) What do you mean by REST API? </h1>
    <p>REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an architectural
        style for designing networked applications. REST is commonly used in the context of web services and web
        development.

        RESTful APIs adhere to a set of principles, including:

        Stateless Communication: Each request from a client contains all the information needed to understand and
        process the request. The server doesn't store any information about the client between requests.

        Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network. The
        client is responsible for the user interface, and the server is responsible for processing requests and managing
        resources.

        Uniform Interface: A set of standardized rules and conventions that simplify and enhance the architecture. This
        includes resources identified by URIs, a constrained set of well-defined operations (e.g., GET, POST, PUT,
        DELETE), and a uniform way of representing resources (e.g., JSON or XML).

        Stateless Communication: Each request from a client contains all the information needed to understand and
        process the request. The server doesn't store any information about the client between requests.

        Resource-Based: Resources, such as data objects or services, are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource
        Identifiers) and are manipulated using standard HTTP methods.

        RESTful APIs are widely used in web development to enable communication between different systems over the
        internet. They provide a scalable and flexible way for applications to interact with each other.</p>
